    <h3>About the Kitchen Sink</h3>
    <p>The UI-Kitchen-Sinks represents the specification, classification, documentation and illustration of UI-Elements in ILIAS.
        It should help:
    <ul>
        <li>Developers to find the right UI-Element for their need</li>
        <li>Customers to check for available resources to fullfill their needs</li>
        <li>Testers to check if a feature is implemented according to UI-Guidelines</li>
        <li>End-Users to have a more streamlined user experience with ILIAS</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <p>In the UI-Kitchen-Sink a lot of existing terms of ILIAS-UI-Items have been reused. However there are some additions worth explaining as well:</p>
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Elements</dt>
        <dd>Elements describe basic functionalities or semantic classes. They are often combined together in collections. Examples are single form input elements, fonts, colors, buttons etc.</dd>
        <dt>Collections</dt>
        <dd>Collections describe combinations of elements. They mostly form tools (such as calendars, info-boxes, forms and tables) that are reused in different places of ILIAS.</dd>
        <dt>View</dt>
        <dd>A view is an arrangement of collections and elements and describes a complete functionality in ILIAS (such as the permissions screen or the personal desktop)</dd>
        <dt>Layouts</dt>
        <dd>Layouts describe ways to arrange elements and tools to form a complete view.</dd>
