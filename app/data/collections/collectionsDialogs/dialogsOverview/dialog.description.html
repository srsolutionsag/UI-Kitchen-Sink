    In the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#dialog">WAI-ARIA roles model</a> 'dialogs' are described as 'an application window that is designed to interrupt the current processing of an application in order to prompt the user to enter information or require a response'.
</p>

    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_dialog_role">Mozilla Dev-Guide</a> further explains that dialogs can either be 'non-modal (it's still possible to interact with content outside of the dialog) or modal (only the content in the dialog can be interacted with)'.
    Marking up a dialog element with the dialog role helps assistive technology identify the dialog's content as being grouped and separated from the rest of the page content. However, adding role="dialog" alone is not sufficient to make a dialog accessible. Additionally, the following needs to be done:
    <ul>
        <li>The dialog must be properly labeled</li>
        <li>Keyboard focus must be managed correctly</li>
    </ul>
</p>
