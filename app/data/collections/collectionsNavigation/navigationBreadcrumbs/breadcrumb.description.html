<p>Breadcrumb uses the Bootstrap concept of Breadcrumb.</p>
<p>The Breadcrumb supplements the main ILIAS navigational concept.
    It is a textual representation of the path that leads to the current location.
    The breadcrumb is only used in the Repository and in the Administration because breadcrumbs are
    only useful for hierarchical and nested levels of objects.</p>
