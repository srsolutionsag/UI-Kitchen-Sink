<p>A form contains one or multiple areas. Each area has a header section containing an identifier (Bezeichner). The first area must have the save and cancel buttons in it's header.</p>
<p>Please consider the following key aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The identifiers SHOULD name the contained settings optimally. They SHOULD contain less than 30 characters.</li>
  <li>An area covers ideally 2 to 5 settings (sections). More than 5 settings SHOULD be split into two areas.</li>
  <li>The MUST NOT be no section without an enclosing area containing an identifier. If necessary an are MAY contain only one setting (section).</li>
  <li>In the "settings" tab of a module the identifier of the first area MUST always be "Edit [NameOfModule]" and contains as first two sections "Title" and "Description". If necessary for the object, the second area should be "availability".
    Settings that can not be properly assigned to any area SHOULD be placed in an area named "Additional Features".
  </li>

</ul>
