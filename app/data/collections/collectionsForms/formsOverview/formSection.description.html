<p>
    A section is composed of an identifier on the left and a form element on the right. A description of the setting configured in a section MIGHT be added bellow the form element on the right side.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the following key aspects for the wording of the <b>identifier (Bezeichner)</b>:
    <ul>
        <li>
            An identifier SHOULD be composed of one single term or a short expression. Elaborate description belong into the description. They identifier works as an eye catcher by browsing over it.
        </li>
        <li>
            You should use short words instead of long construct in the identifier.
        </li>
        <li>
            You MUST be consistent with terms that exist in other objects. E.g. "availability" MUST NOT be renamed to "availableness". If you feel a wording needs to be changed, then you MUST propose it to the JF.
        </li>
        <li class="text-success">
            <b>Good Example</b>: Authentication
        </li>
        <li class="text-danger">
            <b>Bad Example</b>: Authentication method used by a login of a user
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Consider the following key aspects for the wording of the <b>description (Beschreibung)</b>:
<ul>
    <li>
        Description are OPTIONAL. You SHOULD make sure, that a description is really needed. A description that just repeats the wording of the identifier or wording used in the form element is unnecessary. E.g. The sections "Title" and "Description" in the "Settings" tab of modules to not need a description.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a section with many options (such as radio buttons) the description MUST be placed directly underneath to option it describes.
    </li>
    <li>
        You MUST NOT address the user directly in your description text.
    </li>
    <li>
        You MUST express full sentences with a period (.) at the end.
    </li>
    <li>
        You SHOULD phrase short sentences with no more than 25 words.
    </li>
    <li>
        You SHOULD NOT use any formatting in descriptions (bold, italic or similar).
    </li>
    <li>
        You SHOULD NOT parenthesize expressions in your descriptions.
    </li>
    <li>
        You SHOULD NOT only express what a certain setting effects but also explain, why this might be important and what it can be used for.
    </li>
    <li>
        You SHOULD NOT start your description with terms such as:
        <ul>
            <li>If this option is set ...</li>
            <li>If this setting is active ...</li>
            <li>Chose this setting if ...</li>
            <li>This setting ...</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="text-success">
        <b>Good Example</b>: A course set to online is only available in the defined time range.
    </li>
    <li class="text-danger">
        <b>Bad Example</b>: Chose this setting to set to course online for the defined time range only.
    </li>
</ul>
