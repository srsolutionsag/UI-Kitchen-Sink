<p>
    If proposing a new variable, you MUST consider the following points:
    <ul>
        <li>Less variables MUST be named [il-component-they-are-primarely-used-in-functionality-css-attribute-name]. Example: il-modal-body-bg-color.</li>
        <li>All less variables MUST be stored in the variables.less file.</li>
        <li>In the variables.less file, the variables MUST be structured into sections. Each section MUST start with the following name Tag [//== Name of the Section]</li>
        <li>The section names must match the categories the components are stored in. All variables concerning colors must be stored in the section [//== Colors] as an example.</li>
        <li>The variable must also be describe in the according less category of the UI-Kitchen-Sink.</li>
</ul>

    If new less classes are needed they MUST be named according the following pattern [il-id-of-component-name]. Example: il-modal-title
