<p>If the workflow for adding/updating/importing instructs to implement a new component for the UI-Kitchen-Sink, the following points must be checked:</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Point 1, JSON:</dt>
    <dd>Make sure there does not exist already a UI-Kitchen-Sink Element that can be used for the targeted use case.
        You MUST create a new entry if the DOM structure needs to be changed for the specific component only,
        new less code or component specific JS needs to be added. If the change is usable for all existing
        objects of an entry, then you SHOULD just change the existing one.
    If this is not the case you MUST apply the following rules:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Check for the right category in the kitchen sink for your new component. If you think,
                a new category needs to be created, propose it the the UI-Kitchen-Sink group along with a description of this new
                category.
            </li>
            <li>
                You MUST use the <a href="#/content/information/overview/kitchenSinkWorkflows/kitchenSinkTemplate">'UI-Kitchen-Sink Template'</a> to create your pull request for the UI-Kitchen-Sink.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chose an id for your new component. You MUST make sure, the id does not already exist.
            </li>
            <li>
                You SHOULD chose an id, describing the functionality of your component well. If possible, look for a naming that already exists (such as Modal, Popover, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
                If your component is a special version of an existing one, you MUST set the id to [existingComponentNewFunctionality]. Example: modalWithForm. You MUST set the relation of the new
                component with the 'isA' attribute.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Point 2, Bootstrap:</dt>
    <dd>Check on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a> if there exists a Bootstrap component that could be used or just slightly modified.</dd>
    <dt>Point 3, DOM:</dt>
    <dd>Write your own DOM structure. Be sure to follow the guidelines concerning <a href="/#content/information/accessability/guidelines">accessibility</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Point 4, LESS:</dt>
    <dd>Write your own less. You MUST apply the following rules:
        <ul>
            <li>Check if there are existing bootstrap or ILIAS less classes that could be used or extended.</li>
            <li>Check if there are existing bootstrap or ILIAS less mixins that could be used.</li>
            <li>Less variables presented in the UI-Kitchen-Sink SHOULD be used if they fit the context of a given class.</li>
            <li>You MUST check if variables exists for often used attributes such as color or padding.</li>
            <li>Be sure to design your classes mobile-first, meaning first define the class for a mobile device using a media query and in a second step
                add the exceptions for a bigger screen.</li>
            <li>Components MUST have an outermost DOM element with at least the following classes: [il-id-of-parent-1-if-any] [il-id-of-parent-2-if-any] [il-id-component]. Example: il-dialog il-modal il-modal-with-form</li>
            <li>New classes must precede bootstrap classses.</li>
            <li>You SHOULD not use id's for styling. Only use id's for aria-roles and labels or js.</li>
            <li>id's MUST be named in lower camel case. Example: ilModalTitle.</li>
            <li>id's MUST be unique.</li>
            <li>id's MUST proceed any other attributes, followed by classes.</li>
            <li>If custom classes or variables are needed, be sure to follow the <a href="/#content/information/overviewLess/lessOverview/lessNamingConventions">naming conventions</a> for less variables and classnames.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Point 5, JS:</dt>
    <dd>You SHOULD try to avoid JS as much as possible. Often JS code can be avoided by using attributes such as data-toggle and data-target offered by <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#js-overview">bootstrap approprietly.</a>
        See <a href="#/content/collections/tables/filteredTable/">Table Filter</a> as example. If you need to implement JS, you MUST respect the <a href="#/content/information/overviewJavascript/javascriptGuidelines/">JS Guidelines</a>.
