<p>We organise the inventory around two major concepts:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Aggregation:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Elements: Elements are the smallest items in the UI that can be considered ‘whole’.</li>
        <li>Collections: Collections combine elements.</li>
        <li>Layouts: Layouts outline how elements and collections are put together to something greater than a collection.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Interactivity</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Interactive: An entry is considered to be ‘interactive’ if one clicks on the respective control and then something happens.</li>
        <li>Non-interactive:  An entry is considered to be ‘non-interactive’ if information is to be taken from it but no clicking is to be expected.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
