<p>The Elemens in the UI-Kitchen-Sink are grouped into the following categories of UI-Elements:</p>
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Elements</dt>
    <dd>Elements describe basic functionalities or semantic classes. They are often combined together in collections. Examples are fonts, colors, buttons etc.</dd>
    <dt>Collections</dt>
    <dd>Collections describe combinations of elements. They mostly form tools such as calendars, info-boxes, forms and tables that are reused in different places of ILIAS.</dd>
    <dt>Layouts</dt>
    <dd>Layouts describe ways to arrange elements and tools to form a complete view. Layouts are reusable patterns for a given
    context. Most of the layouts are heavily inspired from the great work of <a href="http://designinginterfaces.com/">Jennifer Tidwell</a>.
