<p>The following key words are used to signify the requirements of the UI-Kitchen-Sink specification (According to <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a>):</p>
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>MUST</dt>
    <dd>This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the UI-Kitchen-Sink. Implementation not following such a guideline may be reported as bug.
    </dd>
    <dt>MUST NOT</dt>
    <dd>This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification. Implementation not following such a guideline may be reported as bug.
    </dd>
    <dt>SHOULD</dt>
    <dd>This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
        may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
        particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
        carefully weighed before choosing a different course. It depends strongly on the context if an object not following such a specification can be reported as bug.
    </dd>
    <dt>SHOULD NOT</dt>
    <dd>This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
        there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
        particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
        implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
        before implementing any behavior described with this label. It depends strongly on the context if an object not following such a specification can be reported as bug.
    </dd>
    <dt>MAY</dt>
    <dd>This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
        truly optional.
    </dd>
