    <dt>HTML-File</dt>
    <dd>DOM structure of the new component, named {idOfComponent}.html</dd>
</dl>
<p>If custom less or JS code is needed to render the component you MUST also provide:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>LESS-File</dt>
    <dd>Containing the needed less classes, named {idOfComponent}.html</dd>
    <dt>JS-File</dt>
