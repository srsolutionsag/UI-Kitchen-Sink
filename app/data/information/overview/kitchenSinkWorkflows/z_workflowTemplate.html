<p>If the workflow for adding/updating/importing instructs to implement a new component for the UI-Kitchen-Sink, use the following template to create the JSON object for the component.
You MUST also provide an html file name {idOfComponent}.html with the DOM structure of the new component. If custom less or JS code is needed to render the element, according {idOfComponent}.less
    or {idOfComponent}.js file MUST also be provided.
</p>
